# Prism Training Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of the Prism training scripts to use the `PrismTrainingInterface` instead of directly using the `PrismNetwork`. The refactoring provides a more integrated and efficient training approach with BS-Centric ray tracing and automatic checkpoint management.

## Files Refactored

### 1. `scripts/simulation/train_prism.py`

**Key Changes:**
- **Import Updates**: Added `from prism.training_interface import PrismTrainingInterface`

- **Data Loading**: Enhanced to load antenna indices and BS positions for TrainingInterface
- **Training Loop**: Updated to use TrainingInterface's forward pass and loss computation
- **Checkpoint Management**: Integrated with TrainingInterface's checkpoint system
- **State Tracking**: Uses TrainingInterface's training state management

**Benefits:**
- BS-Centric ray tracing from each BS antenna
- AntennaNetwork-guided direction selection
- Integrated ray tracer for signal accumulation
- Automatic checkpoint management and recovery
- Better training state tracking

### 2. `scripts/simulation/run_training_pipeline.py`

**Key Changes:**

- Better checkpoint management workflow

### 3. `scripts/simulation/test_prism.py`

**Key Changes:**
- **Dual Model Loading**: Supports both TrainingInterface and legacy checkpoint formats
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects checkpoint type and loads accordingly
- **Enhanced Evaluation**: Uses TrainingInterface's forward pass and loss computation when available
- **Data Handling**: Loads antenna indices and BS positions for TrainingInterface compatibility

**Benefits:**
- Backward compatibility with existing checkpoints
- Forward compatibility with new TrainingInterface checkpoints
- Consistent evaluation across both model types

## TrainingInterface Features

The refactored scripts now leverage the following TrainingInterface capabilities:

### 1. **BS-Centric Ray Tracing**
- Ray tracing from each BS antenna independently
- Efficient spatial sampling and direction selection
- Integrated with DiscreteRayTracer for signal accumulation

### 2. **Antenna-Specific Processing**
- Individual antenna embedding processing
- Directional importance sampling per antenna
- Subcarrier selection optimization per antenna

### 3. **Integrated Training Pipeline**
- Automatic checkpoint management
- Training state tracking and recovery
- Curriculum learning support
- Loss computation with subcarrier selection

### 4. **Enhanced Data Handling**
- Support for antenna indices
- BS position integration
- Multi-dimensional CSI data processing

## Configuration Requirements

The refactored scripts require the following configuration sections in your YAML file:

```yaml
neural_networks:
  attenuation_network:
    input_dim: 3
    hidden_dim: 128
    feature_dim: 128
  attenuation_decoder:
    output_dim: 1024  # Number of subcarriers
    num_ue: 1
  antenna_codebook:
    num_antennas: 4
    embedding_dim: 64
    learnable: true

ray_tracing:
  azimuth_divisions: 36
  elevation_divisions: 18
  spatial_sampling: 64
  gpu_acceleration: true
  subcarrier_sampling_ratio: 0.3
  scene_bounds: [[-50, -50, 0], [50, 50, 30]]

performance:
  batch_size: 32
```

## Usage Examples

### Training with TrainingInterface

```bash
# Basic training
python scripts/simulation/train_prism.py \
    --config configs/ofdm-5g-sionna.yml \
    --data data/train_data.h5 \
    --output results/training

# Resume from checkpoint
python scripts/simulation/train_prism.py \
    --config configs/ofdm-5g-sionna.yml \
    --data data/train_data.h5 \
    --output results/training \
    --resume results/training/checkpoints/latest_checkpoint.pt
```

### Complete Pipeline

```bash
python scripts/simulation/run_training_pipeline.py \
    --config configs/ofdm-5g-sionna.yml \
    --data data/sionna_5g_simulation.h5 \
    --output results/complete_pipeline
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test TrainingInterface checkpoint
python scripts/simulation/test_prism.py \
    --config configs/ofdm-5g-sionna.yml \
    --model results/training/checkpoints/best_model.pt \
    --data data/test_data.h5 \
    --output results/testing

# Test legacy checkpoint (backward compatibility)
python scripts/simulation/test_prism.py \
    --config configs/ofdm-5g-sionna.yml \
    --model results/legacy_training/best_model.pt \
    --data data/test_data.h5 \
    --output results/testing
```

## Checkpoint Structure

### TrainingInterface Checkpoints
- **Location**: `output_dir/checkpoints/`
- **Files**: 
  - `checkpoint_epoch_N.pt` - Epoch-specific checkpoints
  - `best_model.pt` - Best performing model
  - `latest_checkpoint.pt` - Most recent checkpoint
- **Content**: Complete model state, training history, subcarrier selection

### Training State Files
- **Location**: `output_dir/`
- **Files**: `training_state_epoch_N.pt`
- **Content**: Optimizer state, scheduler state, training metrics

## Migration Guide

### From Legacy Training

1. **Update Configuration**: Ensure your YAML config includes all required sections
2. **Data Format**: Ensure your HDF5 data includes antenna indices and BS positions
3. **Checkpoint Loading**: The system automatically detects and handles legacy checkpoints
4. **Training**: Use the same command-line interface - the refactoring is transparent

### Benefits of Migration

- **Better Performance**: BS-Centric ray tracing and antenna-specific optimization
- **Easier Management**: Integrated checkpoint and state management
- **Enhanced Features**: Curriculum learning and advanced loss computation
- **Future-Proof**: Built on the modern TrainingInterface architecture

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure `src/` is in your Python path
2. **Configuration Errors**: Verify all required YAML sections are present
3. **Data Format Issues**: Check that antenna indices and BS positions are available
4. **Checkpoint Loading**: Verify checkpoint file paths and formats

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting the log level:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Performance Improvements

The refactoring provides several performance benefits:

- **Efficient Ray Tracing**: BS-Centric approach reduces redundant computations
- **Antenna Optimization**: Individual antenna processing improves parallelization
- **Subcarrier Selection**: Intelligent sampling reduces computational overhead
- **Checkpoint Management**: Faster training recovery and state restoration

## Future Enhancements

The TrainingInterface architecture enables future enhancements:

- **Multi-GPU Training**: Distributed training across multiple GPUs
- **Advanced Loss Functions**: Custom loss functions for specific use cases
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Dynamic model adaptation during training
- **Integration APIs**: Easy integration with other training frameworks

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully modernizes the Prism training pipeline by integrating the TrainingInterface, providing:

- **Better Performance**: More efficient training and inference
- **Enhanced Features**: Advanced ray tracing and antenna processing
- **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner architecture and better separation of concerns
- **Future Extensibility**: Foundation for advanced training features

The refactoring maintains backward compatibility while providing a clear path forward for enhanced Prism network training.
