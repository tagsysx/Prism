# Ray Tracing Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of the discrete electromagnetic ray tracing system for the Prism project. The system implements an efficient voxel-based ray tracing approach that combines discrete radiance field modeling with advanced optimization strategies to achieve both accuracy and computational efficiency.

The core concept is that the system computes **RF signal strength** $S_{\text{ray}}$ at the base station's antenna from each direction, which includes both amplitude and phase information of the electromagnetic wave. A key architectural advantage is that **ray tracing operations are independent**, enabling efficient parallelization using CUDA or multi-threading for significant performance acceleration.

## 1. Core Design

### 1.1 Base Station Configuration

The ray tracing system is centered around base stations (BS) with configurable locations:
- **Default configuration**: Base station positioned at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$
- **Customizable positioning**: Base station location $P_{\text{BS}}$ can be configured for different deployment scenarios
- **Multi-antenna support**: Each base station can have multiple antennas for MIMO operations

### 1.2 Directional Space Division

The antenna's directional space is discretized into a structured grid:
- **Grid dimensions**: $A \times B$ directions
- **Azimuth divisions**: $A$ divisions covering the horizontal plane
- **Elevation divisions**: $B$ divisions covering the vertical plane
- **Angular resolution**: $\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{A}$ (azimuth) and $\Delta \theta = \frac{\pi}{B}$ (elevation)

## 2. Ray Tracing Process

### 2.1 Ray Definition and Parameterization

For each direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$ in the $A \times B$ grid:

```math
\text{Ray}(\phi_i, \theta_j): P_{\text{BS}} + \omega_{ij} \cdot t
```

Where:
- $P_{\text{BS}}$: Base station position
- $\omega_{ij}$: Unit direction vector for direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$
- $t$: Distance parameter along the ray
- $\omega_{ij} = [\sin(\theta_j)\cos(\phi_i), \sin(\theta_j)\sin(\phi_i), \cos(\theta_j)]$

### 2.2 Energy Tracing Process

For each antenna of the base station, the system traces RF energy along all $A \times B$ directions:

1. **Directional initialization**: Initialize ray parameters for each direction
2. **Energy propagation**: Trace electromagnetic energy along each ray using the discrete radiance field model
3. **Attenuation modeling**: Apply material-dependent attenuation coefficients at each voxel intersection
4. **Energy accumulation**: Compute cumulative energy received at user equipment (UE) locations

### 2.3 Advanced Ray Tracing Techniques

The system implements two key optimization strategies (as detailed in the Specification):

#### 2.3.1 Importance-Based Sampling
- **Adaptive sampling density**: Concentrates computational resources in high-attenuation regions
- **Non-uniform discretization**: Optimizes sampling based on material properties
- **Efficiency improvement**: Reduces ineffective computation in low-attenuation areas

#### 2.3.2 Pyramid Ray Tracing
- **Spatial subdivision**: Divides directional space into pyramidal regions
- **Hierarchical sampling**: Implements multi-level sampling strategy
- **Monte Carlo integration**: Improves accuracy within truncated cone regions

#### 2.3.3 MLP-Based Direction Sampling
The system implements an intelligent direction sampling strategy using a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to optimize ray tracing efficiency:

**MLP Architecture**:
- **Input layer**: Accepts the base station's antenna embedding parameter $C$ (typically a high-dimensional vector)
- **Hidden layers**: 2-3 fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions
- **Output layer**: Produces an $A \times B$ indicator matrix $M_{ij}$ where each element $M_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$
- **Activation**: Sigmoid activation at the output layer, followed by thresholding to produce binary indicators

**Direction Selection Process**:
```math
M_{ij} = \text{Threshold}(\text{MLP}(C)_{ij}) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \text{MLP}(C)_{ij} > \tau \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```

Where:
- $M_{ij}$: Binary indicator for direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$
- $\text{MLP}(C)_{ij}$: MLP output for direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$ given antenna embedding $C$
- $\tau$: Threshold parameter (typically $\tau = 0.5$)

**Training Strategy**:
- **Supervised learning**: Train on historical ray tracing data with known optimal direction sets
- **Loss function**: Binary cross-entropy loss comparing predicted indicators with ground truth optimal directions
- **Regularization**: L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Data augmentation**: Generate training samples from different antenna configurations and environmental conditions

**Implementation Benefits**:
- **Adaptive sampling**: Automatically adjusts direction sampling based on antenna characteristics
- **Computational efficiency**: Reduces ray count from $A \times B$ to $\sum_{i,j} M_{ij}$ directions
- **Antenna-specific optimization**: Learns optimal sampling patterns for different antenna types and configurations
- **Real-time adaptation**: Can be updated online as antenna parameters change

**Integration with Ray Tracing**:
The MLP-based direction sampling integrates seamlessly with the existing ray tracing pipeline:

```python
def mlp_direction_sampling(antenna_embedding, mlp_model):
    """
    Use trained MLP to determine which directions to trace
    
    Args:
        antenna_embedding: Base station's antenna embedding parameter C
        mlp_model: Trained MLP model for direction sampling
    
    Returns:
        A x B binary indicator matrix M_ij
    """
    # Forward pass through MLP
    raw_output = mlp_model(antenna_embedding)
    
    # Apply sigmoid and threshold to get binary indicators
    threshold = 0.5
    indicator_matrix = (raw_output > threshold).astype(int)
    
    return indicator_matrix

def adaptive_ray_tracing(base_station_pos, antenna_embedding, ue_positions, 
                        selected_subcarriers, mlp_model):
    """

    Returns:
        Accumulated signal strength for selected directions only
    """
    # Get direction indicators from MLP
    direction_indicators = mlp_direction_sampling(antenna_embedding, mlp_model)
    
    accumulated_signals = {}
    
    # Only trace rays for directions indicated by MLP
    for phi in range(num_azimuth_divisions):
        for theta in range(num_elevation_divisions):
            if direction_indicators[phi, theta] == 1:
                direction = (phi, theta)
                
                # Trace ray for this selected direction
                ray_results = trace_ray(
                    base_station_pos, direction, ue_positions, 
                    selected_subcarriers, antenna_embedding
                )
                
                # Accumulate signals
                for (ue_pos, subcarrier), signal_strength in ray_results.items():
                    if (ue_pos, subcarrier) not in accumulated_signals:
                        accumulated_signals[(ue_pos, subcarrier)] = 0
                    accumulated_signals[(ue_pos, subcarrier)] += signal_strength
    
    return accumulated_signals
```

## 3. RF Signal Computation

### 3.1 Ray Count Analysis

The total number of rays in the system is substantial:

```math
N_{\text{total}} = N_{\text{BS}} \times A \times B \times N_{\text{UE}} \times K
```

Where:
- $N_{\text{BS}}$: Number of base stations
- $A \times B$: Directional grid dimensions
- $N_{\text{UE}}$: Number of user equipment devices
- $K$: Number of subcarriers in the frequency domain

### 3.2 Subcarrier Sampling Optimization

To manage computational complexity, the system implements intelligent subcarrier sampling:

- **Random selection**: For each UE, randomly select $K' < K$ subcarriers
- **Sampling ratio**: $K' = \alpha \cdot K$ where $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ is the sampling factor
- **Reduced complexity**: Effective ray count becomes $N_{\text{BS}} \times A \times B \times N_{\text{UE}} \times K'$

### 3.3 RF Signal Computation

The ray tracer computes RF signal strength at each UE location from each direction:

```math
S_{\text{ray}}(\phi_i, \theta_j, P_{\text{UE}}, f_k, C)
```

Where:
- $S_{\text{ray}}(\phi_i, \theta_j, P_{\text{UE}}, f_k, C)$: Complex RF signal strength received at UE position $P_{\text{UE}}$ from direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$ at frequency $f_k$ with base station antenna embedding $C$
- $C$: Base station's antenna embedding parameter that characterizes the antenna's radiation pattern and properties

### 3.4 Virtual Link Computation

The ray tracer computes accumulated RF signal strength for the optimized set of virtual links:

```math
S_{\text{accumulated}}(P_{\text{UE}}, f_k, C) = \sum_{i=1}^{A} \sum_{j=1}^{B} S_{\text{ray}}(\phi_i, \theta_j, P_{\text{UE}}, f_k, C)
```

Where:
- $P_{\text{UE}}$: UE position
- $f_k$: Selected subcarrier frequency
- $C$: Base station's antenna embedding parameter
- $S_{\text{ray}}(\phi_i, \theta_j, P_{\text{UE}}, f_k, C)$: RF signal strength received from direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$ at frequency $f_k$ with antenna embedding $C$

## 4. Implementation Details

**Implementation Note**: Since ray tracing operations are independent, the system is designed to leverage parallel computing architectures. Consider implementing CUDA kernels or multi-threaded processing for optimal performance.

            )
            results[(ue_pos, subcarrier_idx)] = signal_strength
    
    return results
```
