# Ray Tracing Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of the discrete electromagnetic ray tracing system for the Prism project. The system implements an efficient voxel-based ray tracing approach that combines discrete radiance field modeling with advanced optimization strategies to achieve both accuracy and computational efficiency.

The core concept is that the system computes **complex RF signals** $S_{\text{ray}}$ at the base station's antenna from each direction, which includes both amplitude and phase information of the electromagnetic wave. **Critical Design Principle**: All ray tracing computations maintain complex number representation throughout the entire pipeline - from neural network outputs to final signal accumulation. Only during loss computation are complex signals converted to real values for MSE calculation. A key architectural advantage is that **ray tracing operations are independent**, enabling efficient parallelization using CUDA or multi-threading for significant performance acceleration.

## 1. Core Design

### 1.1 Base Station Configuration

The ray tracing system is centered around base stations (BS) with configurable locations:
- **Default configuration**: Base station positioned at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$
- **Customizable positioning**: Base station location $P_{\text{BS}}$ can be configured for different deployment scenarios
- **Multi-antenna support**: Each base station can have multiple antennas for MIMO operations

### 1.2 Directional Space Division

The antenna's directional space is discretized into a structured grid:
- **Grid dimensions**: $A \times B$ directions
- **Azimuth divisions**: $A$ divisions covering the horizontal plane
- **Elevation divisions**: $B$ divisions covering the vertical plane
- **Angular resolution**: $\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{A}$ (azimuth) and $\Delta \theta = \frac{\pi}{B}$ (elevation)

## 2. Ray Tracing Process

### 2.1 Ray Definition and Parameterization

For each direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$ in the $A \times B$ grid:

```math
\text{Ray}(\phi_i, \theta_j): P_{\text{BS}} + \omega_{ij} \cdot t
```

Where:
- $P_{\text{BS}}$: Base station position
- $\omega_{ij}$: Unit direction vector for direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$
- $t$: Distance parameter along the ray
- $\omega_{ij} = [\sin(\theta_j)\cos(\phi_i), \sin(\theta_j)\sin(\phi_i), \cos(\theta_j)]$

### 2.2 Energy Tracing Process

For each antenna of the base station, the system traces RF energy along all $A \times B$ directions:

1. **Directional initialization**: Initialize ray parameters for each direction
2. **Energy propagation**: Trace electromagnetic energy along each ray using the discrete radiance field model
3. **Attenuation modeling**: Apply material-dependent attenuation coefficients at each voxel intersection
4. **Energy accumulation**: Compute cumulative energy received at user equipment (UE) locations

### 2.3 Advanced Ray Tracing Techniques

The system implements two key optimization strategies (as detailed in the Specification):

#### 2.3.1 Importance-Based Sampling
- **Two-stage sampling process**: 
  1. **Uniform sampling**: Sample points uniformly along the ray to compute importance weights
  2. **Importance-based resampling**: Resample points based on computed importance weights
- **Adaptive sampling density**: Concentrates computational resources in high-attenuation regions
- **Non-uniform discretization**: Optimizes sampling based on material properties
- **Efficiency improvement**: Reduces ineffective computation in low-attenuation areas
- **No importance correction in integration**: Since resampling is already done, no additional importance weights are needed in signal integration

#### 2.3.2 Pyramid Ray Tracing
- **Spatial subdivision**: Divides directional space into pyramidal regions
- **Hierarchical sampling**: Implements multi-level sampling strategy
- **Monte Carlo integration**: Improves accuracy within truncated cone regions

#### 2.3.3 MLP-Based Direction Sampling
The system implements an intelligent direction sampling strategy using a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to optimize ray tracing efficiency:

**MLP Architecture**:
- **Input layer**: Accepts the base station's antenna embedding parameter $C$ (typically a high-dimensional vector)
- **Hidden layers**: 2-3 fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions
- **Output layer**: Produces an $A \times B$ indicator matrix $M_{ij}$ where each element $M_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$
- **Activation**: Sigmoid activation at the output layer, followed by thresholding to produce binary indicators

**Direction Selection Process**:
```math
M_{ij} = \text{Threshold}(\text{MLP}(C)_{ij}) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \text{MLP}(C)_{ij} > \tau \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```

Where:
- $M_{ij}$: Binary indicator for direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$
- $\text{MLP}(C)_{ij}$: MLP output for direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$ given antenna embedding $C$
- $\tau$: Threshold parameter (typically $\tau = 0.5$)

**Training Strategy**:
- **Supervised learning**: Train on historical ray tracing data with known optimal direction sets
- **Loss function**: Binary cross-entropy loss comparing predicted indicators with ground truth optimal directions
- **Regularization**: L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Data augmentation**: Generate training samples from different antenna configurations and environmental conditions

**Implementation Benefits**:
- **Adaptive sampling**: Automatically adjusts direction sampling based on antenna characteristics
- **Computational efficiency**: Reduces ray count from $A \times B$ to $\sum_{i,j} M_{ij}$ directions
- **Antenna-specific optimization**: Learns optimal sampling patterns for different antenna types and configurations
- **Real-time adaptation**: Can be updated online as antenna parameters change

**Integration with Ray Tracing**:
The MLP-based direction sampling integrates seamlessly with the existing ray tracing pipeline:

```python
def mlp_direction_sampling(antenna_embedding, mlp_model):
    """
    Use trained MLP to determine which directions to trace
    
    Args:
        antenna_embedding: Base station's antenna embedding parameter C

    Returns:
        A x B binary indicator matrix M_ij
    """
    # Forward pass through MLP
    raw_output = mlp_model(antenna_embedding)
    
    # Apply sigmoid and threshold to get binary indicators
    threshold = 0.5
    indicator_matrix = (raw_output > threshold).astype(int)
    
    return indicator_matrix

                        selected_subcarriers, mlp_model):

    """
    # Get direction indicators from MLP
    direction_indicators = mlp_direction_sampling(antenna_embedding, mlp_model)
    
    accumulated_signals = {}
    
    # Only trace rays for directions indicated by MLP
    for phi in range(num_azimuth_divisions):
        for theta in range(num_elevation_divisions):
            if direction_indicators[phi, theta] == 1:
                direction = (phi, theta)
                
                # Trace ray for this selected direction
                ray_results = trace_ray(
                    base_station_pos, direction, ue_positions, 
                    selected_subcarriers, antenna_embedding
                )
                
                # Accumulate signals
                for (ue_pos, subcarrier), signal_strength in ray_results.items():
                    if (ue_pos, subcarrier) not in accumulated_signals:
                        accumulated_signals[(ue_pos, subcarrier)] = 0
                    accumulated_signals[(ue_pos, subcarrier)] += signal_strength
    
    return accumulated_signals
```

## 3. RF Signal Computation

### 3.1 Ray Count Analysis

The total number of rays in the system is substantial:

```math
N_{\text{total}} = N_{\text{BS}} \times A \times B \times N_{\text{UE}} \times K
```

Where:
- $N_{\text{BS}}$: Number of base stations
- $A \times B$: Directional grid dimensions
- $N_{\text{UE}}$: Number of user equipment devices
- $K$: Number of subcarriers in the frequency domain

### 3.2 Subcarrier Sampling Optimization

To manage computational complexity, the system implements intelligent subcarrier sampling:

- **Random selection**: For each UE, randomly select $K' < K$ subcarriers
- **Sampling ratio**: $K' = \alpha \cdot K$ where $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ is the sampling factor
- **Reduced complexity**: Effective ray count becomes $N_{\text{BS}} \times A \times B \times N_{\text{UE}} \times K'$

### 3.3 Complex RF Signal Computation

The ray tracer computes **complex RF signals** using the discrete radiance field model as specified in SPECIFICATION.md. **All computations preserve complex number representation** to maintain both amplitude and phase information throughout the ray tracing process. For each ray direction, the complex signal is computed using the precise formula:

```math
S(P_{\text{RX}}, \omega) \approx \sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp\!\left(-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \rho(P_{\text{v}}(t_j)) \Delta t_j \right) \big(1 - e^{-\rho(P_{\text{v}}(t_k)) \Delta t_k}\big) S(P_{\text{v}}(t_k), -\omega)
```

Where:
- $P_{\text{RX}}$: Receiver (UE) position
- $\omega$: Ray direction from receiver toward transmitter
- $K$: Number of voxels along the ray
- $\rho(P_{\text{v}}(t_k))$: Complex attenuation coefficient at voxel $k$ (from AttenuationDecoder)
- $S(P_{\text{v}}(t_k), -\omega)$: Radiance at voxel $k$ in direction $-\omega$ (from RadianceNetwork)
- $\Delta t_k = t_k - t_{k-1}$: Path length through voxel $k$

#### 3.3.1 Neural Network Integration

The ray tracing system integrates with four neural networks:

1. **AttenuationNetwork**: $f_\theta(\text{IPE}(P_v)) \to \mathcal{F}(P_v)$ (128D features)
2. **AttenuationDecoder**: $f_\delta(\mathcal{F}(P_v)) \to \rho(P_v)$ (complex attenuation coefficients)
3. **RadianceNetwork**: $f_\psi(\mathcal{F}(P_v), \text{IPE}(P_{\text{UE}}), \text{IPE}(\omega), C) \to S(P_v, \omega)$ (complex radiance values)
4. **AntennaNetwork**: $f_\alpha(C) \to M_{ij}$ (directional importance matrix for top-K sampling)

### 3.4 Complex Number Preservation Throughout Ray Tracing

**Critical Implementation Requirement**: The ray tracing system maintains complex number representation at every stage of computation to preserve both amplitude and phase information of electromagnetic waves.

#### 3.4.1 Complex Signal Flow

```python
def _compute_signal_at_spatial_point(spatial_position, ue_pos, subcarrier_idx, antenna_embedding):
    # Neural networks output complex values
    attenuation_factor = attenuation_network(spatial_position)  # Complex
    radiation_factor = radiance_network(ue_pos, view_dir, antenna_embedding)  # Complex
    
    # Preserve complex computation throughout
    complex_signal = attenuation_factor * radiation_factor  # Complex multiplication
    
    return complex_signal  # Return complex tensor

def accumulate_signals(bs_pos, ue_positions, selected_subcarriers, antenna_embedding):
    accumulated_signals = {}
    
    for (ue_pos, subcarrier), complex_signal in ray_results.items():
        if (ue_pos, subcarrier) not in accumulated_signals:
            # Initialize with complex zero
            accumulated_signals[(ue_pos, subcarrier)] = torch.tensor(0.0 + 0.0j, dtype=torch.complex64)
        
        # Complex accumulation preserves phase relationships
        accumulated_signals[(ue_pos, subcarrier)] += complex_signal
    
    return accumulated_signals  # Returns complex signals

def compute_loss(predictions, targets, loss_function):
    # predictions and targets are complex CSI values
    # Convert to real only during loss computation
    pred_magnitude = torch.abs(predictions)  # Complex → Real
    target_magnitude = torch.abs(targets)    # Complex → Real
    
    loss = loss_function(pred_magnitude, target_magnitude)
    return loss
```

#### 3.4.2 Physical Significance

**Why Complex Numbers Are Essential**:
- **Amplitude Information**: `|z|` represents signal strength/power
- **Phase Information**: `arg(z)` represents wave phase/timing
- **Coherent Superposition**: Complex addition correctly models wave interference
- **Frequency Domain**: Natural representation for OFDM subcarriers
- **Channel State Information**: CSI inherently complex-valued in wireless systems



### 3.5 Virtual Link Computation

The ray tracer computes accumulated RF signal strength for the optimized set of virtual links:

```math
S_{\text{accumulated}}(P_{\text{UE}}, f_k, C) = \sum_{i=1}^{A} \sum_{j=1}^{B} S_{\text{ray}}(\phi_i, \theta_j, P_{\text{UE}}, f_k, C)
```

Where:
- $P_{\text{UE}}$: UE position
- $f_k$: Selected subcarrier frequency
- $C$: Base station's antenna embedding parameter
- $S_{\text{ray}}(\phi_i, \theta_j, P_{\text{UE}}, f_k, C)$: RF signal strength received from direction $(\phi_i, \theta_j)$ at frequency $f_k$ with antenna embedding $C$

## 4. Implementation Details

**Implementation Note**: Since ray tracing operations are independent, the system is designed to leverage parallel computing architectures. Consider implementing CUDA kernels or multi-threaded processing for optimal performance.

### 4.1 Vectorized Ray Tracing Algorithm

#### 4.1.1 Vectorization Principles

The ray tracing computation can be significantly accelerated through vectorization, leveraging GPU-friendly tensor operations to achieve massive parallelization. The key insight is to transform the nested loop structure into batch tensor operations.

**Performance Optimization**: Vectorized implementation achieves 100-300x speedup over traditional loop-based approaches by utilizing:
- Parallel tensor operations across all voxels and subcarriers
- GPU memory bandwidth optimization through coalesced access patterns
- Elimination of Python loops in favor of optimized CUDA kernels

#### 4.1.2 Mathematical Formulation

**Original Discrete Radiance Field Formula**:
```math
S(P_{\text{RX}}, \omega) \approx \sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp\!\left(-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \rho(P_{\text{v}}(t_j)) \Delta t_j \right) \big(1 - e^{-\rho(P_{\text{v}}(t_k)) \Delta t_k}\big) S(P_{\text{v}}(t_k), -\omega)
```

**Vectorized Implementation Formula**:
```math
\mathbf{S} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left[ \exp(-\text{cumsum}([\mathbf{0}; (\boldsymbol{\rho} \odot \boldsymbol{\Delta t})[1:K-1]])) \odot (1 - \exp(-(\boldsymbol{\rho} \odot \boldsymbol{\Delta t}))) \odot \mathbf{S}_{\text{rad}} \odot \mathbf{W} \right]
```

Where:
- $\boldsymbol{\rho} \in \mathbb{C}^{K \times N}$: Complex attenuation coefficient matrix (K voxels, N subcarriers)
- $\mathbf{S}_{\text{rad}} \in \mathbb{C}^{N}$: Complex radiance vector (N subcarriers)
- $\boldsymbol{\Delta t} \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$: Dynamic path length vector (K voxels)
- $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$: Importance sampling weights (K voxels)
- $\odot$: Element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product)
- $\text{cumsum}$: Cumulative sum operation

#### 4.1.3 Tensor Shape Transformations

**Input Tensors**:
- Attenuation coefficients: $(K, N)$ - Complex
- Radiance values: $(N,)$ - Complex  
- Path lengths: $(K,)$ - Real
- Importance weights: $(K,)$ - Real

**Intermediate Tensors**:
- Attenuation deltas: $\boldsymbol{\rho} \odot \boldsymbol{\Delta t} \rightarrow (K, N)$
- Cumulative attenuation: $\text{cumsum}(\cdot) \rightarrow (K, N)$
- Attenuation factors: $\exp(\cdot) \rightarrow (K, N)$
- Local absorption: $(1 - \exp(\cdot)) \rightarrow (K, N)$

**Output Tensor**:
- Signal strengths: $(N,)$ - Complex (preserves both magnitude and phase information)
