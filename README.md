# Prism: RF Neural Radiance Fields for OFDM Communication

A PyTorch-based implementation of wideband RF neural radiance fields for OFDM communication systems, combining discrete electromagnetic ray tracing with neural network-based optimization.

## Overview

Prism implements an efficient voxel-based ray tracing approach that combines discrete radiance field modeling with advanced optimization strategies to achieve both accuracy and computational efficiency. The system is designed for RF signal strength computation in wireless communication scenarios, particularly for OFDM systems.

## Key Features

- **Neural Radiance Fields**: Advanced neural network-based RF signal modeling
- **OFDM Communication Support**: Optimized for wideband OFDM systems
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA support for high-performance computations
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, extensible design for different use cases
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test suite and validation tools
